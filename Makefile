##
## Prerequisites and how this works ##
##
## Rendering the HTML files from .md and .Rmd input files will be run
## within a Docker container. The benefit of this is that the
## rendering will run in a software environment that is highly
## consistent between otherwise vastly different machines, and you do
## not need to worry about installing the numerous components (R, a
## variety of R packages, TeX/LaTeX, pandoc, etc) of this environment
## yourself. It does mean, however, that docker must be able to
## run. On non-Linux systems, this will require having VirtualBox or
## another VM hosting software installed and started up, which is
## typically accomplished through executing boot2docker. You may need
## to set some environment variables after that; your boot2docker
## program will usually tell you what to do.
##
## Once you have prepared your environment for running docker, you can
## test the build by issuing 'make test', which at present is
## synonymous with 'make html'. I.e., the website build is tested by
## rendering all HTML content.
##
## The website is built in the build/ directory by first copying there
## all .md and .Rmd files from the root directory and a list of
## subdirectories, followed by running rmarkdown::render from within
## R.
##
## The deployment of the website, currently hosted on Github Pages, is
## initiated, but not completed by 'make deploy'. This will create a
## TAR archive of the website content. At present, pushing the archive
## contents to Github Pages is done by the Continuous Integration (CI)
## server (see circle.yml for details), though you may of course also
## do so by hand if you have the necessary permissions.
